# Tips & Tricks

Coming soon:

- Creating bash scripts using Nix (`writeShellScriptBin`)
- Writing to `/etc` and using environment linking to handle `.config` files (And why I prefer this to home manager)
- System-wide program synced configurations (e.g. a system-wide color scheme that is controlled using a simple Nix file)
